						<h2>Blog 1: New data reveals timing could be key to a successful job search</h2>

						<p>
							Survey suggests March, September and November are the best time to find a new role. With the
							global workforce still in the middle of The Great Resignation or the slump, one company has
							uncovered new data that suggests those looking for their next opportunity may need to take a
							strategic approach to finding their dream role. Specialist cloud technology recruitment firm
							Frank Recruitment Group has looked at the number of job interviews and placements made with
							them in the last 12 months, finding some significant results. March saw both the highest
							number of job interviews arranged as well as jobs placed, with September seeing the next
							highest number of placements made, closely followed by November. “For any professional
							seeking their next role it suggests hiring isn’t just about your ability, but it’s about
							timing, which means a degree of strategy is needed for the savvy applicant,” said the firm’s
							Chairman and CEO, James Lloyd Townshend. “We all know that summer can be affected by hiring
							managers taking summer vacation, while winter can be a tough time for jobhunting as
							companies start to wind down towards the end of the year. So it’s imperative that you add
							value to your personal brand in these periods, rather than becoming downhearted by any
							potential lack of opportunities.” Investing in yourself as a professional won’t just help
							you to stand out during the application stage, but spending the quieter times focusing on
							other things such as industry certifications will also increase your market worth when it
							comes to salary negotiations. Daniel Callaghan, CEO and co-founder of employee screening
							platform Veremark agrees that it’s a time for strategy rather than panic. He said: “Quieter
							months needn’t be idle months. They can be used to research companies you might want to work
							for and to ready your resumé and LinkedIn profile for scrutiny. Both of these should match,
							without any unexplained gaps in your education or career history. Unaccounted–for periods
							get flagged as discrepancies during screening, and you won’t want to unwittingly slow down
							the hiring process.” So what are the other ways to ensure you get noticed? Andrew Arkley,
							founder and Director of resumé writing company Purple CV, says it’s important to tailor it
							each time to match the company’s website and job description. “Read them thoroughly,” he
							says, “and pick out keywords and phrases to include in your resumé. You can also tailor your
							previous experience to fit the skills they’re looking for.” He also suggests keeping your
							background rooted in real-world examples. “Try to use facts and figures throughout, that
							support your statements and demonstrate your value to the hiring manager,” he adds. “These
							examples can come from your previous work history or from your education experience and
							extracurricular activities—however, it should have a professional tone. Avoid using the
							first person, and keep in mind that including too much personal opinion or using informal
							language can put recruiters off.” Once you’ve done that, and triple-checked it for the basic
							mistakes and typos that can look careless to potential employers, Daniel suggests sitting
							back and being patient. “There is seasonality to hiring,” he said. “In part this is dictated
							by the habits of hiring managers who need to be present to write job descriptions and
							oversee interviews, but also because they want to make sure their advertisements are seen by
							the largest talent pool possible. That’s why the number of job ads drops during typical
							holiday seasons such as July, August and December—March to April, and October to November
							are our peak months for screening candidates.” In short, the evidence suggests that finding
							the perfect job really could come down to timing. So, the advice for those looking for their
							dream role isn’t just to be ready for that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to come up, but to
							understand why it may be taking so long to appear and use that time wisely to prepare.

						<h2>Blog 2: Creative Ways to Stand Out in a Job Interview</h2>
					</button>
					<p>
						One must infuse extraordinary aspects into their job interview if they want interviewers to
						remember them. Yes, conforming to the normal standard is safe, but it’s not always memorable—and
						it’s boring! Employers interview a lot of applicants each day, so you have to make yourself
						stand out from the rest of the applicants. Sure, you’re a great candidate—you have all the
						qualifications, winning personality, and compelling track record—but guess what? So are the
						other candidates. So, what can you do to stand out from them, and how can you show the
						interviewer that you deserve the job more than the rest of the candidates? In this article, we
						will share with you some creative ways to do just that. You may also want to check Top Career
						Zone for more tips and advice related to job search, interviews, career growth, and more! #1: Do
						your research You should be able to ace the most asked interview question: What do you know
						about our company? If you are planning to just recite the “About Us” page you read on their
						website, you better think again! Go the extra mile. Read their annual report so you can get the
						whole picture what matters to the organization and the type of “language” the company uses—in
						other words, identifying their DNA! #2: Act like you already have the job In a job interview,
						your goal is to make the interviewer want to hire you. You will impress the interviewer by not
						just doing your research but also demonstrating exactly how you’d be of value to the company. Be
						prepared enough to show what you would do over the course of your probationary period when you
						start your job. You can lay out a series of well-thought-out ideas, including how you would
						approach a problem in the workplace and what you would need from the organization for support.
						Don’t shy away from this opportunity to showcase your interpersonal skills. #3: Find common
						ground Connecting with the interviewer on something in common is a creative way for your
						interviewer to remember who you are. Know a few details about your interviewer and see if you
						have any commonalities. Whether it’s a shared interest in movies, food, or travel, make the
						connection clear but brief. #4: Wear a bold outfit Of course, the business dress code standards
						must be observed, but you can still let your amazing personality shine through by wearing a bold
						color or a striking accessory. This outfit should serve as a visual hint that tells them you’re
						not like the rest of the candidates—different, but better! That should make a lasting
						impression. #5: Include the company values in your answer As you do your research, you will also
						come across the company values. Show them you understand the values that matter to the company.
						Discuss how you would solve a particular problem or situation in the workplace through the prism
						of those values. If you find that the company values accountability, discuss with them how you
						would use a transparent approach. #6: Ask unanticipated questions A successful interview should
						also include questions you ask your interviewer. Its importance is often disregarded by most job
						applicants. The kind of questions you ask will determine how extensive your research on their
						company is. You can ask them about certain projects they are working on or their target goals
						for the year. #7: Bring along your pet to a pet-friendly office Again, doing your research on
						the company will go a long way. It can help you plan ways to make yourself more memorable, even
						the most creative ones—and probably unheard of too! What is their office culture? If you find a
						specific aspect of the company that is peculiar, like an office that welcomes pets, why not give
						it a go? With their permission, you can bring your dog or cat! #8: Send a personalized note
						post-interview What better way to make yourself memorable than by sending a handwritten thank
						you note to your potential employer following a job interview. It may not be that unusual, but
						it’s also not a frequent thing people do, especially with the internet nowadays. Also, there’s
						nothing quite like an old-fashioned courtesy that will likely earn you the stamp of approval. To
						make it even more effective, reference parts of your conversation during the interview to show
						how engaged you were. Conclusion With the help of the creative strategies listed above, you will
						definitely stand out no matter what job you will be interviewed for. You will leave a lasting
						impression whether you are the first or last candidate to be interviewed! In today’s competitive
						job market, it’s important to make yourself stand out because employers are interviewing a lot
						of candidates for each role. Seeing someone different can be refreshing—and memorable!.
